  Gatsby advanced Contentful & TypeScript starter
</h1>

Kick off your project with this advanced boilerplate. This starter ships with combination of the extensive [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) template [https://github.com/apptension/cra-template-apptension](https://github.com/apptension/cra-template-apptension) by Apptension focused on building React SaaS applications with the Gatsby ecosystem [https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) to create an extensive Gatsby template for advanced websites.

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying our starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using starter
    gatsby new my-new-project https://github.com/m1chalkubiak/gatsby-advanced-contentful-typescript-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-new-project/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-new-project` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ✨ Main Features

- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) integration with ready to go placeholder content. Built-in support for using components inside [rich text content types](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/rich-text-and-gatsby/).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support configured together with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) provides you with static types checking and helps with maintaining good code style.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) to use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress.
- Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging. Used with [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/), [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer), [Redux Toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) and configured for Redux DevTools to speed up development.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for running tests, mocking, assertions and snapshots. Take advantage of [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for rendering and interacting with React components.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for interactively develop and test components in isolated environment by running yarn storybook.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
